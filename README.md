===========

This is for students to download and play with and push, before you mess up your own code.

My bad for telling you to use BitBucket instead. Such is computer science.  Test lots, use what works, sometimes you waste time.  Can you see my different commits on this readme?  Try pulling the repo.

Try adding a file (name it with your name) and pushing it to the repo.
